# AF3BB

_**A**lpha**F**old**3** **B**atch **B**inder_ (**AF3BB**)Â is a local pipeline forÂ **high-throughput screening of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) using AlphaFold3**. Given a target protein and multiple candidate binding proteinsâ€”such as an antigen with a set of potential antibody candidatesâ€”AF3BB automates the structure prediction and binding assessment process,Â enabling efficient identification of strong interactors and providing insights into potential binding epitopes.

### **Key Features**

- **Batch Processing**: Predicts interactions between a target protein and multiple candidates in parallel.
- **Automated Workflow**: Streamlines structure prediction, docking, and scoring.
- **Epitope Analysis**: Helps identify potential antibody binding sites on the target protein.
- **Customizable**: Allows users to fine-tune parameters for different use cases.
- **Local Execution**: Runs efficiently on local machines or HPC clusters, avoiding cloud dependencies.

AF3BB is designed for researchers seeking a fast and scalable solution to explore protein-protein interactions using AlphaFold3. ðŸš€
